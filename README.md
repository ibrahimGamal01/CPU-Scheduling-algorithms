# CPU-Scheduling-algorithms

The program simulates four CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.

For each algorithm, the program calculates the average waiting time and average turnaround time of the processes given in the main function.

The main function initializes a vector of processes and then calls the functions that implement the four scheduling algorithms.

The output of the program includes the name of the scheduling algorithm and the corresponding average waiting time and average turnaround time.

The program is written in C++ and uses the STL library, specifically, the queue and vector data structures, as well as the priority queue container adapter.

Overall, the program is well-structured and provides a clear implementation of the four CPU scheduling algorithms.
